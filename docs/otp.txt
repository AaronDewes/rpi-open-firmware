28: the 32bit serial# of the chip, as seen in `cat /proc/cpuinfo
the lower 24 bits of the serial# also become the last 3 bytes of the ethernet mac`

this comment explains more of the reg17 flags then the official docs do

rpi3 (and maybe older)
  reg17:
    bit 0, brick the pi! (may enable signature checks)
    bit 1, 1==19.2mhz
    bit 3, enable SDIO pullup
    bit 5, NAND/SMI boot
    bit 8, SMI data bus width
      0=8bit
      1=16bit
    bit 9-10, change SMI bus timings, 0->1cycle, 1->2cycles, 2->3cycles, 3->10cycles
    bit 19, enable GPIO bootmode
    bit 21, enable booting from SD card
    bit 22 sets bank to boot from
    bit 27, BSC slave boot on gpio 18/19
    bit 28, enable usb device booting
    bit 29, enable usb host booting (mass-storage, ethernet)
    bit 30-31, SPI boot
      0 disable
      1 gpio 7-11

rpi4:
  reg17:
    bit 1, 0=54mhz crystal, 1=192.mhz
    bit 4-6, spi boot pins
      0 = none
      1 = gpio 7-11 alt0
      2 = gpio 35-39 alt0
      3 = gpio 40-43 alt4 (pre-burned)
      4 = gpio 46-49 alt2
    bit 7, usb device boot (over usb-c port), only used if eeprom fails checksum
    bit 11-13, emmc pins
      0 = none
      1 = ???
      2 = gpio 22-27 alt3
      3 = gpio 34-39 alt3
      4 = gpio48-53 alt3 (wired to sd card slot)
